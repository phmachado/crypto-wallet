# CryptoWallet

CryptoWallet is a web app that works as a virtual wallet for your Reais (R$), Bitcoins (BTC) and Britas (B$) (cryptocurrency equivalent to USD). 

The APIs used on this project to check the current prices of the currencies were [Mercado Bitcoin](https://www.mercadobitcoin.net/api/BTC/ticker/) and [Banco Central](https://dadosabertos.bcb.gov.br/dataset/taxas-de-cambio-todos-os-boletins-diarios).
